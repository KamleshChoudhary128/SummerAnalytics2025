## üöó Dynamic Pricing Models: Linear vs XGBoost

 This repo has **two pricing models** for predicting ride or parking prices:

* ‚úÖ **Model 1:** A simple **Linear Formula**
* üöÄ **Model 2:** A smarter **XGBoost ML Model**

## üìÇ What‚Äôs Inside

| Part                 | Description                                                       |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dataset.csv`        | Your input data: occupancy, capacity, queue length, traffic, etc. |
| `linear_pricing.py`  | Basic model with a simple linear formula.                         |
| `xgboost_pricing.py` | Advanced model using XGBoost regression.                          |

## ‚ö°Ô∏è 1Ô∏è‚É£ Linear Pricing Formula

### üßê What it does

A hand-crafted formula:

> **Price = Base Price + Occupancy Effect + Queue Effect**

Where:

* `Base Price` = \$10.00
* `Occupancy Effect` = more cars ‚Üí higher price
* `Queue Effect` = longer wait ‚Üí higher price

It uses:

```python
BASE_PRICE = 10.0
alpha = 8.0  # occupancy weight
queue_weight = 0.5  # queue weight
```

### üõ†Ô∏è How it works

1. Calculates `occupancy_ratio = Occupancy / Capacity`
2. Computes `target_price` with the formula above
3. Predicts price with the **same** formula ‚Üí so your MAE will be zero (duh!)

### üìä Visuals

* **Target vs Predicted** ‚Äî sanity check (should be a perfect diagonal line).
* **Price vs Occupancy Ratio** ‚Äî shows how price goes up with occupancy.

## ü§ñ 2Ô∏è‚É£ XGBoost Dynamic Pricing Model

### üßê What it does

Uses machine learning (XGBoost regressor) to learn how **real-world factors** affect price. It‚Äôs more flexible because it considers:

* Occupancy ratio
* Queue length
* Traffic conditions (low/average/high)
* Is it a special day?
* Vehicle type (car/bike/truck)
* Time of day
* Day of week

### üß© How it works

1. **Feature Engineering:**

   * Extract `Hour` and `DayOfWeek`
   * Encode traffic & vehicle type
   * Calculate a **Demand Factor** (custom function) ‚Üí combines all factors using math & sigmoid magic.

2. **Target Price:**

   ```python
   target_price = BASE_PRICE * demand_factor
   ```

3. **Train-Test Split:**

   * Train XGBoost on 80% of data
   * Test on 20% ‚Üí get RMSE

4. **Prediction:**

   * Clips final prices within `0.6x` to `2.0x` base price.

5. **Real-Time Function:**

   * Plug in live values ‚Üí get dynamic price.

## üîç Visuals

* **Actual vs Predicted:** scatter plot to see how well XGBoost fits.
* **Feature Importance:** bar chart to see which features matter most.
* **Hourly Pricing Pattern:** see how price changes by hour.
* **Price Distribution:** see price spread & base price limits.

## üí° How to Run

1. Make sure you have:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib xgboost scikit-learn
   ```

2. Put `dataset.csv` in the same folder.

3. Run:

   ```bash
   python linear_pricing.py
   python xgboost_pricing.py
   ```

4. Check your console & the plots!
